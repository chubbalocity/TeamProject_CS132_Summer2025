Team Building and the team project:

In general, team building and team management are very challenging tasks. There are a variety of resources available to help improve teamwork skills. Some of which include but are not limited to the Atlassian University, Managing team collaboration with Microsoft Teams, and LinkedIn's Improve Your Teamwork Skills. 

Students are encouraged to form their own teams at the beginning of the course. The "Introduce Yourself" discussion forum provides a good platform for students to learn about each other and find good fits for their teams.

In case students have not been included in a team, they will automatically be assigned to a random one by the instructor by the end of Week 2.
