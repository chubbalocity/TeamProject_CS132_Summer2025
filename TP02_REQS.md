Team Project Progress Submission (by Module 07)
During this phase, each team should fulfill the additional following requirements in the console window as an output. Each team will adjust your program (submitted to TP01) and add functions if needed to meet the needs. As you're adding the lines and functions, the comments for important steps are required including function summary.

Requirement #1:  Create 2 shoulders for the road (left shoulder and right shoulder) using "|" bars within the window size and repeat the overall steps so that the road gets updated line by line in the following pattern. 

        |                                       |
        |                                       |
        |                                       |
